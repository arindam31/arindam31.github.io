Over the years, Iâ€™ve built projects that reflect how I think, \
solve problems, and have fun with code. This site is a space to \
show you those projects â€” complete, imperfect, and real â€” \
so you can get a broader idea of the kind of solutions I enjoy building. \
Itâ€™s less of a portfolio, more of a playground. And if you happen to find \
something useful, inspiring, or just interesting â€” even better.";
